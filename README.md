1. All data is stored in the Memory.

   - It stores the data into the memory so it doesn't have to look for the Hard Drive
   - One downside to this is when we restart the memory will be cleaned

2. Use of _Data Structures_ to Organize the Data.

   - It uses the efficient Data Structure to store the data
     - Linked List, Sorted set, HashMap
   - This helps to efficiently query data

3. Redis is very simple feature
